# Gearbox Design & Analysis Project

## Project Overview
Designed and assembled a multi-stage gearbox using SolidWorks. 
Performed detailed 3D modeling and assembly with correct mating conditions.

## Tools Used
- SolidWorks
- AutoCAD
- CATIA (Basic Modeling)

## Design Features
- Spur Gear Modeling
- Shaft Design
- Bearing Placement
- Assembly Constraints
- Exploded View Creation
- 2D Technical Drawings
- Bill of Materials (BOM)

## Analysis
Performed basic torsional stress analysis to evaluate shaft strength and load capacity.

## Objective
To understand power transmission systems and mechanical design principles in gearbox systems.
